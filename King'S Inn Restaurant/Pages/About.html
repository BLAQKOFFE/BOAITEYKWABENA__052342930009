  <p class="long-text">Welcome to my culinary journey! I'm B L A Q K O F F, a passionate young man with a love for all things food. Growing up, I was always fascinated by the magic that happens in the kitchenâ€”how simple ingredients come together to create something extraordinary. This fascination led me to start my own restaurant, a dream I've nurtured for years. At Li-Franc, we believe in serving more than just food. We serve experiences, memories, and a little piece of our heart in every dish. Our menu is a reflection of my culinary adventures, blending traditional flavors with a modern twist. Each recipe has a story, a moment, or an inspiration behind it.
    As I embark on this exciting journey, I invite you to join me. Let's explore new tastes, share stories, and create unforgettable dining experiences together. Thank you for being a part of Li-Franc Restaurant. Here's to good food, great company, and the joy of sharing a meal.</p>
